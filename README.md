# Psychopy Experiments

This repository contains two distinct Psychopy experiments designed for cognitive psychology research.

## Project 1: Real vs. Imagined Words

In this experiment, participants are presented with words and are required to distinguish between real and imagined words. The goal is to explore cognitive processes involved in word recognition and the ability to differentiate between imagined and real stimuli.

### Features:
- Participants are presented with a series of letters forming words.
- They must respond by indicating whether the word is real or imagined.
- The experiment records reaction time and accuracy for each trial.

## Project 2: Math Problem Solving

This experiment tests participants' abilities to solve math problems of variable difficulty (addition and subtraction). The goal is to assess reaction times and accuracy in performing basic arithmetic under timed conditions.

### Features:
- Participants are presented with a set of addition and subtraction problems.
- They must respond with the correct answer using number keys (0-9).
- The experiment records reaction time and accuracy for each trial.
- The script calculates the percentage of correct responses and average reaction time for each block.

Both experiments have been designed with data collection in mind, and the results are saved in a CSV file for further analysis.
